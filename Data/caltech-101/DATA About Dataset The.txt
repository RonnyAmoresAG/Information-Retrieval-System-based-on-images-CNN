About Dataset
The Caltech101 dataset contains images from 101 object categories (e.g., “helicopter”, “elephant” and “chair” etc.) and a background category that contains the images not from the 101 object categories. For each object category, there are about 40 to 800 images, while most classes have about 50 images. The resolution of the image is roughly about 300×200 pixels.
